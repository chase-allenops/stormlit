[Using data provided by NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/), I created a Streamlit app to explore the amount of severe storms by state and storm type. 

Over the last few years, it felt like Indiana had been experiencing more severe storms than when I was a kid. Was I biased? Maybe.

As an adult I own things like a house, and cars, and my dog is afraid of thunder so I'm acutely aware of the weather nowadays. 

But were there really more storms? I wanted to know. 

Turns out, there aren't any more thunderstorms today than there were back in the 1990s and 2000s. In fact, there isn't a significant uptick in tornadoes in Indiana despite how it feels every summer hearing the sirens. 

One thing that was surprising to me was the amount of property and crop damage (~$390 BILLION) that occurred in 2017 due to the aftermath of a turbulent hurricane season.
